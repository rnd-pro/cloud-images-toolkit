## Requirements

- Node.js 20.0.0+
- npm 10.0.0+

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev cloud-images-toolkit
```

## Configuration

Create a `cit-config.json` file in your project root:
```json
{
  "syncDataPath": "./cit-sync-data.json",
  "imsDataPath": "./ims-data.json",
  "imgSrcFolder": "./cit-store/",
  "apiKeyPath": "./CIT_API_KEY",
  "apiUrl": "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/images/v1",
  "baseUrl": "https://your-domain.com/images/",
  "variants": ["120", "320", "640", "860", "1024", "1200", "2048", "max", "public"],
  "imgTypes": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "webp", "gif", "svg"],
  "wsPort": 8080,
  "httpPort": 8081
}
```
This configuration example is set to work with the [Cloudflare Images API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/). For other CDN and API providers, you may set custom endpoints or your own API-adapters.

To use custom URLs for your images, you need to enable this feature and configure it in your service provider dashboard. 

In case you using Cloudflare Images, you can find the instructions [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/manage-images/serve-images/serve-from-custom-domains/).

> **Important**: Add your image folder and API key file to `.gitignore`

## Usage

Start the toolkit server:
```bash
node ./node_modules/cloud-images-toolkit/src/node/serve.js
```

Or add `cit` script to your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "cit": "node ./node_modules/cloud-images-toolkit/src/node/serve.js"
}
```

And then use npm script:
```bash
npm run cit
```

Then open the dashboard at: `http://localhost:<httpPort>`

## Variants

Variants are very important part of the CIT workflow. They are necessary for the adaptive image embed code generation and image size control. CIT uses the convention of the variant names to generate the image URLs, based on the image width.

For example, if you have a variant named `120`, CIT will generate the URL for the image with the width of 120px.

It's a good practice to create variants for the screens with different DPI. For example, you can create a variant for the image with the width of `120` and the DPI of 1.0, and another variant for the image with the width of `240` and the DPI of 2.0.

In case you using the Cloudflare Images API, you need to create the variants in your Cloudflare Images account. More details you can find [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/manage-images/serve-images/serve-uploaded-images/).
