## Requirements

- Node.js 20.0.0+
- npm 10.0.0+

## Quick Start

Run without installing:
```bash
npx cloud-images-toolkit
```

If no config file is found, CIT will offer to create one from the reference template.

## Installation

### Global installation

```bash
npm install -g cloud-images-toolkit
```

Then run from any project directory:
```bash
cit
```

### Local installation

```bash
npm install cloud-images-toolkit
```

Add a script to your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "cit": "node ./node_modules/cloud-images-toolkit/src/node/serve.js"
}
```

Then:
```bash
npm run cit
```

## Configuration

Create a `cit-config.json` file in your project root. A reference template is included in the package as [`cit-config_REFERENCE.json`](./cit-config_REFERENCE.json):

```json
{
  "name": "My Collection",
  "cdn": "cloudflare",
  "syncDataPath": "./cit-sync-data.json",
  "imsDataFolder": "./ims-widgets/",
  "imsDataMinify": true,
  "imgSrcFolder": "./cit-store/",
  "apiKeyPath": "./CIT_API_KEY",
  "projectId": "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
  "imgUrlTemplate": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/images/{UID}/{VARIANT}",
  "previewUrlTemplate": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/images/{UID}/{VARIANT}",
  "imsUrlTemplate": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/ims/{HASH}.json",
  "variants": ["120", "320", "640", "860", "1024", "1200", "2048", "max"],
  "imgTypes": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "webp", "gif", "svg"],
  "wsPort": 8080,
  "httpPort": 8081
}
```

### Multi-Collection Support

CIT supports managing multiple collections simultaneously. Instead of a single object, you can configure `cit-config.json` as an array of collection objects. Each collection will operate independently with its own CDN settings, keys, and paths. A reference for this format can be found in [`cit-config_MULTI_REFERENCE.json`](./cit-config_MULTI_REFERENCE.json).

When the `cdn` field is set, CIT uses a built-in connector that auto-fills upload, fetch, and remove URL templates with provider-specific defaults. You can still override any template manually.

To use custom URLs for your images, you need to enable this feature and configure it in your service provider dashboard.

> **Important**: Add your image folder and API key file to `.gitignore`:
> ```
> cit-store/
> CIT_API_KEY
> cit-config.json
> ```

### URL Template Syntax

CIT uses specific macros in URL templates to dynamically construct paths. These macros are automatically replaced with runtime values:

- `{UID}` — The unique identifier of the image (typically the CDN ID).
- `{VARIANT}` — The specific variant string requested (e.g., `320`, `public`).
- `{PROJECT}` — Your configured `projectId` (e.g., Cloudflare Account ID, Cloudinary Cloud Name).
- `{HASH}` — The MD5 hash used in the `imsUrlTemplate` to identify an Interactive Media Spot (IMS) descriptor file.

## CDN Connectors

CIT includes built-in connectors for popular image CDN providers. Set the `cdn` field in your config to activate a connector.

### Cloudflare Images

```json
{ "cdn": "cloudflare", "projectId": "<ACCOUNT_ID>" }
```

**API key file** (`CIT_API_KEY`): your Cloudflare Images API Bearer token.

**Variants**: must be pre-created in your [Cloudflare Images dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/manage-images/serve-images/serve-uploaded-images/). Use [custom domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/manage-images/serve-images/serve-from-custom-domains/) for custom image URLs.

### Cloudinary

```json
{ "cdn": "cloudinary" }
```

**API key file** (`CIT_API_KEY`): three values separated by colons:
```
cloud_name:api_key:api_secret
```

The `projectId` is auto-extracted from the cloud name. Variants map to Cloudinary's URL-based width transformations (e.g. variant `320` → `w_320,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto`).

### ImageKit

```json
{ "cdn": "imagekit" }
```

**API key file** (`CIT_API_KEY`): two values separated by a colon:
```
private_key:url_endpoint
```

Example: `your_private_key:https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id`

Variants map to ImageKit's URL-based transformations (e.g. variant `320` → `tr:w-320`).

### Bunny.net

```json
{ "cdn": "bunny" }
```

**API key file** (`CIT_API_KEY`): three values separated by colons:
```
storage_password:storage_zone:pull_zone_url
```

Example: `your-password:my-zone:https://my-zone.b-cdn.net`

Variants map to Bunny Optimizer query parameters (e.g. variant `320` → `?width=320`). Make sure [Bunny Optimizer](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/stream-image-processing) is enabled on your pull zone.

### Custom / No Connector

Omit the `cdn` field and provide all URL templates manually. CIT will use `Bearer` auth with the raw API key:

```json
{
  "projectId": "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
  "imgUrlTemplate": "https://...",
  "uploadUrlTemplate": "https://...",
  "fetchUrlTemplate": "https://...",
  "removeUrlTemplate": "https://..."
}
```

## Variants

Variants are very important part of the CIT workflow. They are necessary for the adaptive image embed code generation and image size control. CIT uses the convention of the variant names to generate the image URLs, based on the image width.

For example, if you have a variant named `120`, CIT will generate the URL for the image with the width of 120px.

It's a good practice to create variants for the screens with different DPI. For example, you can create a variant for the image with the width of `120` and the DPI of 1.0, and another variant for the image with the width of `240` and the DPI of 2.0.

For Cloudflare Images, variants must be pre-created in the Cloudflare dashboard. For Cloudinary, ImageKit, and Bunny.net, variants are applied dynamically via URL-based transformations.

## Troubleshooting

### Config not found
CIT looks for `cit-config.json` in the current working directory. Make sure you're running the command from your project root. When run without a config, CIT will offer to create one from the reference template.

### API key errors
Ensure your API key file path in `cit-config.json` points to a valid file. The file format depends on your CDN connector — see the [CDN Connectors](#cdn-connectors) section for details.

### Port conflicts
If manually pre-configured ports (like `8080` or `8081`) are already in use by other applications, update `wsPort` and `httpPort` in your config file to use different ports. Alternatively, you can omit these properties from your configuration, and CIT will automatically discover and bind to available network ports.

### Upload failures
CIT automatically retries failed uploads up to 3 times. Check your API key and network connection if uploads consistently fail.
